    "content": "When describing the rejection sampling algorithm, we showed that we could define the probability a sample was accepted as $\\frac{1}{M}$. Here the constant M is defined as: \\(\\sup_{x \\in \\Omega}\\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}\\) Note that if $q(x) = p(x)$ then the sample would always be accepted. Similarly, if $q(x) = c p(x)$ where c is a constant, then the probability of acceptance would become $\\frac{1}{c}$. Of course, this definition leads to conclusion that if two distributions are more “overlapping”, then the probability of acceptance draws closer to 1 (Figure add). The challenge with rejection sampling is $M &lt; \\infty$. Often times, M being less than infinity is not the case removing both the interpretation of overlap and rendering rejection sampling useless. We’d like to find a way to remove this unnecessary constraint and find a definition of overlap that works for any $p(x)$, $q(x)$. ",

    "content": "The second sampling algorithm we analyzed was the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. One of the key properties of MH we derived was that it guarantees convergence to the stationary distribution under the condition of detailed balance. This provides an algorithm that works for any $p(x), q(x)$ regardless of how slow that convergence may be. This provides a significant advantage over Rejection Sampling since we can define overlap for any $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. However, the challenge now is defining overlap in the MH algorithm. Claim: The integral $\\int \\int \\alpha(x’,x)p(x)q(x’)\\text{d}x\\text{d}x’$ gives us a measure of overlap of the MH algorithm. We’ll define Z to be a Bernoulli random variable indicating whether or not our sample was rejected and we’ll start with the following set up: . Suppose a target distribution $q(x)$ and a proposal distribution $p(x)$. Let $X \\sim q(x)$ and $Y \\sim p(y)$. We’d like to know the probability X can replace Y after the test: $u &lt; \\alpha(X, Y)$. Define $z$ to be a r.v st: \\(X' = \\begin{cases} X \\text{ with probability } \\alpha(X, Y) \\\\ Y \\text{ with probability } 1-\\alpha(X, Y) \\end{cases}\\) . We’d like show $X’ \\sim q(x)$. Clearly if we reject our sample $X$, $X’ \\sim q$ since $X’ = Y$. If we accept the sample, then we were saying $X$ can replace $Y$. We can make the following observation of the probability of replacement: . \\(\\Pr(Z=1 \\cap X' \\in A | X) = \\int \\int \\int_A 1(U &lt; \\alpha(X, Y)) q(x)p(y)\\text{d}u\\text{d}x\\text{d}y\\) \\(= \\int \\int \\alpha(x,y)q(x)p(y)\\text{d}x\\text{d}y\\) Where $A$ is the sample space of $q(x)$. This is our overlap measure, we call it r. \\(r = \\int \\int \\alpha(x,y)q(x)p(y)\\text{d}x\\text{d}y\\) Since r is a well defined probability, $r \\in [0,1]$ and has the following interpretation: . | If r is close to zero, that indicates the target and proposal are distinct distributions since there is a low replacement probability. | If r is close to one, then the proposal and distinct are similar distributions. | Computing r directly may not be always possible, the probability must be estimated using Monte Carlo methods. &lt;/ol&gt; In conclusion, since the Metropolis Hastings converges to the target distribution for any proposal distribution, the overlap measure for the Metropolis Hastings works for any two $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. This allows us to determine the similarity between samples coming from two different distributions by determining how likely one sample is to replace the other. ## Similarity measures: p-value vs Overlap The p-value is the probability a test statistic is at least as extreme as the actual observed value, given that a null hypothesis is true. One common application of the p-value is to test the differences between two populations (X and Y) by using the means from the observed samples and constructing the following null hypothesis: $$ H_0 \\colon \\ \\mu_X - \\mu_Y = 0 \\quad H_1 \\colon \\ \\mu_X - \\mu_Y \\neq 0 $$ We arrive at what is referred to as the two sample t-test. By rejecting the null hypothesis, we accept strong evidence to suggest the means are not the same, indicating a difference between the two populations. The threshold for p-value (commonly referred to as $\\alpha$) is selected based on a widely accepted consensus, typically .05. However, given the goal is to measure differences between two populations, the threshold we set for the p-value is uninformative about the difference between the two populations. Instead of the p-value, we'd like to focus on $r$ and its interpretation as a measure of replacement between two populations to describe similarity between distinct distributions. ### Example: p-value vs. Overlap For this example, we'll consider two populations: $$X_1, X_2, ..., X_N \\text{ i.i.d from N(0,1)} $$ and $$Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_N \\text{ i.i.d from N(}\\mu \\text{,1)}$$ where $\\mu \\in [0,2]$. We'd like to compare the similarity of the two distributions using both a two sample mean test and $r$ and highlight the difference between the two measures as $\\mu$ grows larger and the distributions grow farther apart. Since $r$ cannot be directly computed, it must be estimated using Monte Carlo methods. We'll estimate r using the following code: ``` python import pandas as pd import scipy import numpy as np # Generate data np.random.seed(42) # For reproducibility means = np.arange(0, 200) / 100 x = scipy.stats.norm.rvs(size=50) y = scipy.stats.norm.rvs(size=50) # Fit KDE for x (fixed) fx_hat = scipy.stats.gaussian_kde(x) fx_s = fx_hat.resample(1000).flatten() # Pre-sample overlaps = [] p_values = [] for mu in means: y_mu = y + mu # Fit KDE for shifted y fy_hat = scipy.stats.gaussian_kde(y_mu) #Drawing 1000 samples from the fy hat fy_s = fy_hat.resample(1000).flatten() # Two-sample t-test (two-sided by default) tstat, p_val = scipy.stats.ttest_ind(x, y_mu, equal_var=False) # Welch's t-test p_values.append(p_val) # Monte Carlo overlap estimation eps = 1e-10 # Small constant to avoid division by zero numerator = fx_hat(fy_s) * fy_hat(fx_s) denom = fx_hat(fx_s) * fy_hat(fy_s) alpha = np.minimum(1, (numerator / denom)) overlaps.append(np.mean(alpha)) # Store results df = pd.DataFrame({'Overlap': overlaps, 'p-value': p_values}, index=means) ``` We obtain the following result: \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\linewidth]{overlap (normal).png} From this example we see as the p-value dips below .05 and we begin to reject the null hypothesis, the overlap remains high at roughly .75 probability a sample from $\\text{N(0,1)}$ could replace a sample from $\\text{N(}\\mu,1)$. From this example, we see the additional information we gain from using the overlap measure could be far more valuable to the researcher since three-fourth's of samples from one group could replace those of the other group. | | .

    "title": "Overview",
    "content": "Rejection Sampling is an algorithm that provides us with an intuitive way to sample random variables from a target distribution, $q(x)$, that cannot be sampled from directly but whose function form is known. We do so by using a proposal distribution, $p(x)$, that can be sampled from directly. The rejection sampling algorithm requires samples drawn from $p(x)$ to be evaluated on a probability the sample can be assumed to have been drawn from $q(x)$. If the sample is not assumed to be drawn from $q(x)$, the sample is rejected and the process is repeated. The underlying acceptance of the sample drawn from $p(x)$ relies on the overlap between $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. If $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are similar distributions then we say the two distributions have high overlap and samples drawn from either distribution could be said to have been drawn from the other. The opposite is true for distributions with low overlap. Rejection sampling provides us with an introductory understanding of overlap as we define the likelihood samples can replace each other with the constant $M$: . \\[M = \\sup_{x \\in \\Omega} \\frac{q(x)}{p(x)} &lt; \\infty\\] We note that $M \\geq 1$: . Proof: . Suppose $ M &lt; 1 $. Since $M$ is the supremum of $\\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}$, then for all $x$: \\(M \\geq \\frac{q(x)}{p(x)} \\implies M p(x) \\geq q(x).\\) . Integrating both sides: \\(M \\int p(x) \\, dx \\geq \\int q(x) \\, dx.\\) Since $ p(x) $ and $ q(x) $ are p.d.f.s, $ \\int p(x) \\, dx = \\int q(x) \\, dx = 1 $. Thus: . \\[M \\geq 1,\\] which contradicts the assumption $ M &lt; 1 $. QED . Since $M \\geq 1$, we know the following must be true for $q(x)$: . | $q(x) \\geq p(x) \\space \\forall x \\in \\Omega$ | $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ share the same $\\Omega$ | . In rejection sampling we define overlap with $M$ since $M$ serves as a measure of similarity between $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. If $M$ is very close to 1, $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are quite similar. if M is very close to 0, $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are not similar. Note, a downside to rejection sampling is that $M$ must exist which heavily constrains the number of density functions we can apply rejection sampling sampling to. However, we know based on what was said above, the following figure shows us the relationship between $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. Once we’ve determined $M$, we can generate samples $X_1,X_2,…,X_n$ from $p(x)$ and apply the rejection sampling algorithm. We will show the accepted samples will then follow the target distribution $q(x)$. We can condense the above into the followin algorithm: . 1.Draw a sample $X \\sim p(x)$ . 2.Draw a sample $u \\sim U[0,1]$ . 3.If $u &lt; \\frac{q(x)}{M*p(x)}$ then $X \\sim q$, else: Discard $X$ and $u$ . 4.Repeat . Here is an example of the algorithm implemented in Python: . import numpy as np import scipy def rejection_sampling(num_samples, M, prop_dist, target_dist): samples = [] for _ in range(num_samples): x = prop_dist.rvs() #Random variable from our proposed distribution u = scipy.stats.uniform.rvs() #Random variable from our uniform distribution #Ratio is the realized random variable evaluated at both the proposed and the target distributions ratio = target_dist.pdf(x) / (prop_dist.pdf(x)*M) if u &lt;= (ratio): # Accept-reject condition samples.append(x) return np.array(samples) . Example . Here we use $p \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2})$ to target a standard exponential distribution: . Proof of Rejection Sampling . Our goal is to show that if we follow the rejection sample algorithm, the random variable we drew $X$ from $p(x)$, can be said $X \\sim q(x)$. Probability theory tells us that if $X \\sim q(x)$, the following are equivalent: . \\[\\Pr(X \\in A) = \\int_A q(x)\\text{dx} = Q(x)\\] Where $A$ is sample space of $q(x)$. This will be the idea we wish to prove. When we run the rejection sampling algorithm, there exists some probability we accept or reject the sample. This probability is random before the algorithm begins and based on the fact that we accept or reject, the outcome is binary. Whether or not the outcome occurs for every iteration of the algorithm is a random variable (r.v) that we call $Z$ where $Z$. We’ve defined the conditions when a sample $X$ is accepted rejected in the algorithm and it is based on the inequality: . $U &lt; \\frac{q(x)}{M*p(x)}$ . It follows that since M is the supremum of $\\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}$, if M exists then $\\frac{q(x)}{M*p(x)}$ is bounded on the interval of $[0,1]$ for all $x$ in the support of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. We can now assign the probability the event occurs to our new random variable $Z$ as: \\(Z \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\frac{q(x)}{Mp(x)})\\) . Now that $Z$ is well defined, we turn our attention to the following: . \\[X \\space | \\space Z=1\\] Essentially, what is the distribution of $X$ after we’ve accepted the sample? We want to show that given we’ve accepted our sample, we can say $X|Z=1 \\sim q(x)$. To do so we’ll need the following: \\(\\Pr(X \\in A | Z=1) = Q(x)\\) where $A$ is the sample space of $q(x)$. | Using Bayes’ Theorem we can rewrite $\\Pr(X \\in A | Z=1)$ as: | . \\[\\Pr(X \\in A | Z=1) = \\frac{\\Pr(Z = 1 | X \\in A) \\cdot \\Pr(X \\in A)}{\\Pr(Z=1)}\\] Lets turn our attention to the numerator. Since we have a conditional probability, we can make the following observation: . \\[\\Pr(Z = 1 | X \\in A) = \\frac{\\Pr(Z=1 \\cap X \\in A)}{\\Pr(X \\in A)}\\] By multiplying both sides by $\\Pr(X \\in A)$ and plugging the right hand side into the numerator we arrive at: . \\[\\Pr(X \\in A | Z=1) = \\frac{\\Pr(Z=1 \\cap X \\in A)}{\\Pr(Z=1)}\\] Looking deeper into $\\Pr(Z=1 \\cap K \\in A)$, this is something we can evaluate: By the law of Total Probability: . \\[\\Pr(Z=1 \\cap K \\in A) = \\int_{A} (U &lt; \\frac{q(x)}{Mp(x)}) \\cdot p(x)\\text{dx} = \\iint_{0}^{1} (U &lt; \\frac{q(x)}{Mp(x)}) \\cdot p(x) \\text{dx} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{q(x)}{Mp(x)}\\cdot p(x) \\text{dx}\\] \\[\\Rightarrow \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{q(x)}{M}\\text{dx} = \\frac{1}{M} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}q(x)\\text{dx} = \\frac{1}{M} \\Pr(X \\in A) = \\frac{1}{M} \\cdot Q(x)\\] Now we turn our focus to the denominator $\\Pr(Z=1)$. \\[\\Pr(Z=1) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 1(U &lt; \\frac{q(x)}{Mp(x)}) p(x) \\text{dx} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{q(x)}{Mp(x)}p(x) \\text{dx} = \\frac{1}{M} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} q(x)\\text{dx} = \\frac{1}{M} (1) = \\frac{1}{M}\\] Finishing up we arrive at out final result: . \\[\\Pr(X \\in A | Z=1) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{M} \\Pr(X \\in A)}{\\frac{1}{M}} = \\Pr(X \\in A) = Q(x)\\] Therefore, given we accept the random variable we sampled, we’ve shown $X \\sim q(x)$.

A target distribution is a function whose form is known but whose constant of proportionality is unknown and/or cannot be calculated through traditional methods or numerical methods. Because the constant of proportionality cannot be calculated, traditional methods of sampling such as the inverse CDF method cannot be applied. We’ll assume the rejection sampling method does not work here for our proposal and target distributions. Instead, we turn to the Metropolis Hastings algorithm which works by also works by an iterative process. The Metropolis Hastings algorithm draws samples from a proposal probability density function and based on an overlap measure, the sample is accepted or rejected. After some number of iterations, the samples accepted by MH algorithm follow target distribution, without ever calculating the constant of integration. Example . Suppose $q(x) \\sim N(0,1)$ and $p(x) \\sim N(1,2)$ where $p(x)$ is a distribution that is easy to sample from and $q(x)$ is difficult to sample from.

However, we first need to find $\\Pr(x_{n+1} | x_n)$ is before we can show the stationary condition holds. Finding $\\Pr(X_{n+1} | X_n)$: $X_{n+1}$ can take on two values. Either $X_{n+1}$ takes on the values of $x’$ with some probability w(x) or the sample is rejected in which case $X_{n+1} = x_n$. We can represent this as: . \\[X_{n+1} = \\begin{cases} x' \\text{ determined by w(x)} \\\\ x_n \\text{ 1- w(x)} \\end{cases}\\] | Since we are looking to determine $\\Pr(X_{n+1} | X_n)$, using the Law of Total Probability, we get: | . \\[\\Pr(X_{n+1} | X_n) = \\text{Pr}(X_{n+1} = x' | X_{n} = x_{n} ) + (1- \\text{Pr}(X_{n+1} = x' | X_{n} = x_{n} )) \\cdot 1(X_{n+1} = X_n)\\] | Where $1(X_{n+1} = X_n)$ is an indicator variable that tells us our sample was rejected.

Detailed Balance tells us the rate of transition given we start at $x’$ and move to $x_n$ must be equal to the rate of transition given we start at $x_n$ and move to $x’$. For the Metropolis Hastings, this looks like: . \\[q(x')\\Pr(X_{n+1} = x'| X_n = x_n) = q(x_n)\\Pr(X_{n+1} = x_n | X_{n} = x')\\] Claim: The Metropolis Hastings algorithm satisfies detailed balance. From the previous section we know the probability of transition is: . \\[\\Pr(X_{n+1} = x'| X_n = x_n) = p(x'|x_n)\\alpha(x',x_n) =p(x'|x_n) \\min \\{ 1, \\frac{q(x')p(x_n|x')}{q(x_n)p(x'|x_n)} \\}\\] We can expand the RHS further: . \\[=\\min\\{p(x'|x_n), \\frac{q(x')p(x_n|x')}{q(x_n)}\\}\\] If we multiply both sides by $q(x_n)$, we get: . \\[\\Pr(x'|x_n)q(x_n)= \\min ( q(x_n)p(x'|x_n),q(x')p(x_n|x'))\\] \\[\\Rightarrow \\Pr(x'|x_n)q(x_n) = \\Pr(x_n|x')q(x')\\] Thus, the Metropolis Hastings Algorithm satisfies detailed balance. We can integrate both sides w.r.t $x_n$ and find: \\(q(x') = \\int \\Pr(x' |x_n)q(x_n)dx_n\\) \\(\\Rightarrow q(x_{n+1}) = \\int \\Pr(x_{n+1} |x_n)q(x_n)dx_n\\) . ",
