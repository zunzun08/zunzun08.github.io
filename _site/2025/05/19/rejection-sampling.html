    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Rejection Sampling is an algorithm that provides us with an intuitive way to sample random variables from a <strong>target distribution</strong>, $q(x)$, that cannot be sampled from directly but whose function form is known. We do so by using a <strong>proposal distribution</strong>, $p(x)$, that can be sampled from directly. The rejection sampling algorithm requires samples drawn from $p(x)$ to be evaluated on a probability the sample can be assumed to have been drawn from $q(x)$. If the sample is not assumed to be drawn from $q(x)$, the sample is rejected and the process is repeated. The underlying acceptance of the sample drawn from $p(x)$ relies on the overlap between $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. If $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are similar distributions then we say the two distributions have high overlap and samples drawn from either distribution could be said to have been drawn from the other. The opposite is true for distributions with low overlap. Rejection sampling provides us with an introductory understanding of overlap as we define the likelihood samples can replace each other with the constant $M$:</p>

\[M = \sup_{x \in \Omega} \frac{q(x)}{p(x)} &lt; \infty\]

<p>We note that $M \geq 1$:
<br /></p>

<h3 id="proof"><strong>Proof:</strong></h3>

<p>Suppose $ M &lt; 1 $.</p>

<p>Since $M$ is the supremum of $\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}$, then for all $x$:
\(M \geq \frac{q(x)}{p(x)} \implies M p(x) \geq q(x).\)</p>

<p>Integrating both sides:
\(M \int p(x) \, dx \geq \int q(x) \, dx.\)
Since $ p(x) $ and $ q(x) $ are p.d.f.s, $ \int p(x) \, dx = \int q(x) \, dx = 1 $. Thus:</p>

\[M \geq 1,\]

<p>which contradicts the assumption $ M &lt; 1 $.</p>

<p><strong>QED</strong></p>

<p>Since $M \geq 1$, we know the following must be true for $q(x)$:
<br /></p>
<ol>
  <li>$q(x) \geq p(x) \space  \forall x \in \Omega$
<br /></li>
  <li>$p(x)$ and $q(x)$ share the same $\Omega$</li>
</ol>

<p>In rejection sampling we define overlap with $M$ since $M$ serves as a measure of similarity between $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. If $M$ is very close to 1, $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are quite similar. if M is very close to 0, $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are not similar. Note, a downside to rejection sampling is that $M$ must exist which heavily constrains the number of density functions we can apply rejection sampling sampling to. However, we know based on what was said above, the following figure shows us the relationship between $p(x)$ and $q(x)$.</p>

<p>Once we’ve determined $M$, we can generate samples $X_1,X_2,…,X_n$ from $p(x)$ and apply the rejection sampling algorithm. We will show the accepted samples will then follow the target distribution $q(x)$.</p>

<p>We can condense the above into the followin algorithm:</p>

<p>1.Draw a sample $X \sim p(x)$</p>

<p>2.Draw a sample $u \sim U[0,1]$</p>

<p>3.If
$u &lt; \frac{q(x)}{M*p(x)}$ then $X \sim q$,  else: Discard $X$ and $u$</p>

<p>4.Repeat</p>

<p>Here is an example of the algorithm implemented in Python:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import numpy as np
import scipy
def rejection_sampling(num_samples, M, prop_dist, target_dist):
    samples = []
    for _ in range(num_samples):
            x = prop_dist.rvs()  #Random variable from our proposed distribution
            u = scipy.stats.uniform.rvs()    #Random variable from our uniform distribution
                
            #Ratio is the realized random variable evaluated at both the proposed and the target distributions

            ratio = target_dist.pdf(x) / (prop_dist.pdf(x)*M)
            
            
            if u &lt;= (ratio):  # Accept-reject condition
                
                samples.append(x)
    return np.array(samples)
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Here we use $p \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda = \frac{1}{2})$ to target a standard exponential distribution:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/rejection_sampling_example.png" alt="RS Exp Example" width="400" /></p>

<h3 id="proof-of-rejection-sampling">Proof of Rejection Sampling</h3>
<p>Our goal is to show that if we follow the rejection sample algorithm, the random variable we drew $X$ from $p(x)$, can be said $X \sim q(x)$. Probability theory tells us that if  $X \sim q(x)$, the following are equivalent:</p>

\[\Pr(X \in A) = \int_A q(x)\text{dx} = Q(x)\]

<p>Where $A$ is sample space of $q(x)$. This will be the idea we wish to prove.</p>

<p>When we run the rejection sampling algorithm, there exists some probability we accept or reject the sample. This probability is random before the algorithm begins and based on the fact that we accept or reject, the outcome is binary. Whether or not the outcome occurs for every iteration of the algorithm is a random variable (r.v) that we call $Z$ where $Z$. We’ve defined the conditions when a sample $X$ is accepted rejected in the algorithm and it is based on the inequality:</p>

<p>$U &lt; \frac{q(x)}{M*p(x)}$</p>

<p>It follows that since M is the supremum of $\frac{q(x)}{p(x)}$, if M exists then $\frac{q(x)}{M*p(x)}$ is bounded on the interval of $[0,1]$ for all $x$ in the support of $p(x)$ and $q(x)$. We can now assign the probability the event occurs to our new random variable $Z$ as:
\(Z \sim  \text{Bernoulli}(\frac{q(x)}{Mp(x)})\)</p>

<p>Now that $Z$ is well defined, we turn our attention to the following:</p>

\[X \space | \space Z=1\]

<p>Essentially, what is the distribution of $X$ after we’ve accepted the sample? We want to show that given we’ve accepted our sample, we can say $X|Z=1 \sim q(x)$. To do so we’ll need the following:
\(\Pr(X \in A | Z=1) = Q(x)\)
where $A$ is the sample space of $q(x)$.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Using Bayes’ Theorem we can rewrite $\Pr(X \in A</td>
      <td>Z=1)$ as:</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

\[\Pr(X \in A | Z=1) = \frac{\Pr(Z = 1 | X \in A) \cdot \Pr(X \in A)}{\Pr(Z=1)}\]

<p>Lets turn our attention to the numerator. Since we have a conditional probability, we can make the following observation:</p>

\[\Pr(Z = 1 | X \in A) = \frac{\Pr(Z=1 \cap X \in A)}{\Pr(X \in A)}\]

<p>By multiplying both sides by $\Pr(X \in A)$ and plugging the right hand side into the numerator we arrive at:</p>

\[\Pr(X \in A | Z=1) = \frac{\Pr(Z=1 \cap X \in A)}{\Pr(Z=1)}\]

<p>Looking deeper into $\Pr(Z=1 \cap K \in A)$, this is something we can evaluate:
By the law of Total Probability:</p>

\[\Pr(Z=1 \cap K \in A) = \int_{A} (U &lt; \frac{q(x)}{Mp(x)}) \cdot p(x)\text{dx} = \iint_{0}^{1} (U &lt; \frac{q(x)}{Mp(x)}) \cdot p(x) \text{dx} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{q(x)}{Mp(x)}\cdot p(x) \text{dx}\]

\[\Rightarrow \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{q(x)}{M}\text{dx} = \frac{1}{M} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}q(x)\text{dx} = \frac{1}{M} \Pr(X \in A) = \frac{1}{M} \cdot Q(x)\]

<p>Now we turn our focus to the denominator $\Pr(Z=1)$.</p>

\[\Pr(Z=1) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} 1(U &lt; \frac{q(x)}{Mp(x)}) p(x) \text{dx} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{q(x)}{Mp(x)}p(x) \text{dx} = \frac{1}{M} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} q(x)\text{dx} = \frac{1}{M} (1) = \frac{1}{M}\]

<p>Finishing up we arrive at out final result:</p>

\[\Pr(X \in A | Z=1) = \frac{\frac{1}{M} \Pr(X \in A)}{\frac{1}{M}} = \Pr(X \in A) = Q(x)\]

<p>Therefore, given we accept the random variable we sampled, we’ve shown $X \sim q(x)$.</p>
