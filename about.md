        <p>Hi!,
            <br>
            I am a first generation Mexican-American from Dallas, Texas.
            I've lived in Dallas my whole life up until college where I moved to the University of Texas at Austin.
            In Austin, I found my love for mathematics during my first semester in my Calculus course.
            I became obsessed with learning as much math as possible in the very limited time I had in college. After a few
            semesters, I found that I really gravitated to statistics and had accumulated a bunch of knowledge but nowhere to put
            it!
            So please join me on this journey as I continue to dive deeper and deeper into the field of statistics
            and how these tools can be used to explain complex, real-world relationships.
        </p>
