        <p>Hi!,
            <br>
            I am a first-generation Mexican-American from Dallas, Texas. I've lived in Dallas my whole life until college when I moved to the University of Texas at Austin.

            I discovered my passion for mathematics during my first Calculus course here at UT where I originally came in as an Economics major. After my first Calculus class, I became obsessed with learning as much math as possible during my time as an undergrad. Eventually adding a Math major under my belt with the hopes of becoming a data scientist. After a few semesters I realized I had accumulated all this knowledge and had no where to put it! That's why I'm excited to share what I've learned through this platform.

            Join me as I explore statistical tools and their applications to real-world relationships.
