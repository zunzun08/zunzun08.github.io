<h1>About </h1>

<p>Hi!,
    <br>
    I am a first generation Mexican-American from Dallas, Texas.
    I've lived in Dallas my whole life up until college where I moved to the University of Texas at Austin.
    In Austin, I found my love for mathematics during my first semester in my Calculus course.
    I became obsessed with learning as much math as possible in the very limited time I had in college. After a few
    semesters, I found that I really gravitated to statsitcs and had accumulated a bunch of knowledge but nowhere to put
    it!
    So please join me on this journey as I continue to dive deeper and deeper into the field of statistics.
