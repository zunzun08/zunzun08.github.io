    <h2>Sampling and Simulation</h2>
    <p> A detailed look into different sampling algorithms designed to build intuition over the idea of
        distributional similarity.
        The measure of distributional similarity that's built up to in this deep dive is the Overlap
        measure. The overlap measure tells us given
        two individuals drawn from distinct distributions, how likely is it that we can replace one with the
        other? The order in which we arrive at these ideas is
        sequential and we observe that regardless of its complexity, sampling algorithms have to use some
        measure of distributional similarity to work.
