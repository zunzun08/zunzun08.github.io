# Introduction

In quantiative finance, speed is everything. The faster news can be processed and identified as good or bad for a trader then faster securities can be moved. To address this need for speed and accuracy, I want to build a sentiment analysis model that quickly quantifies the sentiment of real-time, relevant financial news articles of publicly traded companies. To start, I need a model that achieves the following:

- Injest news articles from major American news sources along with news aggregators for sentiment on general, daily, stock market sentiment
- Store data obtained from web crawling, model training, and model predictions
- Store the trained Large Language Model for quick prediction, one off prediction

Ultimately I developed:

The construction of the system will be seperated into three parts including:
