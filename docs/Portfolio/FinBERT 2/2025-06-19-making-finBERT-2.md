# Introduction

I was asked by a friend who has been working on building his expertise in the world of quantitative trading to build a sentiment analysis model to quickly quantify the sentiment of recent, relevant financial news articles of specific publicly traded companies as a component for a portfolio he was looking to build and manage. I agreed and began to build an end to end system that was capable of the following:

- Injest news articles from major American news sources along with news aggregators for sentiment on general, daily, stock market sentiment
- Store data obtained from web crawling, model training, and model predictions
- Store the trained Large Language Model for quick prediction, one off prediction

Here's the system I ultimately developed:

The construction of the system will be seperated into three parts including:
[Model Building]
[Scraper Development]
[Database and pipeline Development]
